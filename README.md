# Dentist-Office
A simple Java application about a dentist office.

This program is created for an dentist office, where the doctors and nurses can log in with their personal accounts. The users can see all the appointments and all the patients.
They can also filter them by date, type, etc and add, remove or update them.

This is my first "big" Java program. My little that I've accomplished by writting this project are: 
  - mastering the most important OOP concepts
  - working with serialized files
  - creating my second UI and working with JavaFx 
  - functional programming

Other things I want to add and achieve:
  - a database for the users and for clients
  - developing a more advanced UI
  - creating an encrypted password system

I am very proud of this project because I have achived more than I was asked to do and I really feel I've learned the basics.
